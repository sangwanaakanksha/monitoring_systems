Design of digital system to solve for monitoring issue of public facilities by public department

Problem Statement 
  1. Lack of actionable information for monitoring and reviewing
  2. Poor coordination among sanitation department, poor deployment of limited human and financial resources
  3. Lack of feedback system to capture citizen/user observations around the facility, leading to trust deficit between government & citizens

Diagnosis post field visits and stakeholder interviews
  1. Lack of information about number, condition and operation level fo public washrooms in a District. Poor information about distribution of washrooms across the urban region.
  2. Reviews by high level stakeholders irregularly scheduled, lack of visibility, dependent on field reports presented by workers
  3. Some facilities being operated by third party, but no information on contract, renewals or quality of service
  4. Infrastructure upgrade a major pain point combined with tedious process of approvals, tendering and inter-department coordination

Solution Design
  1. Phase wise building monitoring system, that includes citizen feedback and gamification to improve overall quality of public washrooms in the District.
  2. Phase 1 - Designing a comprehensive digital system, that collects data regarding state of washrooms, which is analyzed and presented in an actionable format to drive reviews and meetings. Starting with ~ 60 toilets in urban areas.
